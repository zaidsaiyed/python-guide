2.2.1 The First Program
Letâ€™s start by copying and running Prog 2-01 in Eclipse. We know you may not understand this program for now and that is fine. The purpose of the program is to test your Python installation and to introduce comments. Please consult module 1 of the course if you need any help in running the program.

# Calculate total pay
salary = 2500.0
bonus = 1200.0
pay = salary + bonus
print('Your pay is', pay)
```

Code Listing 1: This program shows the use of comments. Understanding of the code is not required at the moment.
Prog 2-01 in Code Listing 1 will ask you to enter your favorite quote and then the program will pause execution and wait for your response. You can enter any text that you like. Once your press the return key on your keyboard, the program will print your quote on the console in reverse. Just before finishing, ********* Program Ending ********* will also be printed.

Console 1 shows the output of the program. We entered an anonymous quote when prompted by the program for input.
